Project Title:
Vision Based Framework for Automatic Interpretation, Classiﬁcation and   Detection of Construction   Workers and Site Equipment
Objective of the Project: The project, "Vision Based Framework   for   Automatic Interpretation, Classiﬁcation   and   Detection   of   Construction   Workers   and   Site   Equipment,"   is   an   innovative   initiative that aims to streamline construction site management using   advanced   computer   vision   techniques.   The primary   goal of   this project is   to   develop   a robust   system   capable   of   interpreting,   classifying,   and   detecting   construction workers   and site equipment in real-time.The   system   should   utilize   machine   learning   algorithms   and   computer vision   to   analyze video feeds from surveillance cameras installed at construction sites.   It   can accurately identify and classify   various elements on a construction site, such   as   different types   of   equipment, vehicles,   and workers. This   information   can   be   used   to monitor site activities,   track equipment usage, and ensure   worker safety.Furthermore,   the   system   can   detect   any   unusual   activities   or   potential   safety   hazards, alerting site supervisors to take immediate action. This not only   enhances operational efficiency but also signiﬁcantly improves safety standards   on construction sites.This project represents   a signiﬁcant advancement in the   ﬁeld of construction site   management, demonstrating the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence and computer   vision in   automating   and   optimizing   complex processes. It   should pave   the   way   for   a new era of smart, safe, and efficient construction practices.
Data Collection: Utilize a dataset containing images of construction   workers and   site equipment (or a dataset of   your choice).Algorithms: You should implement one or more代 写MA2 Department of Computing - 2024/2025 Capstone ProjectPython
代做程序编程语言 algorithms of your choice,   selecting one from each category and using the same dataset for   all   algorithms:   ML   Algorithm   or   DL   Algorithm   (Deel   Learning   is   recommended)
Evaluation Metrics: 
Algorithms   should   be   compared   based   on   various      metrics,   including   but   not   limited   to:Accuracy: Proportion   of   correctly   classiﬁed   instances, Precision:   Ratio   of   true   positives   to   the   total predicted positives, Recall: Ratio   of   true positives   to   the   total   actual   positives, F1-Score:   Harmonic   mean of   precision and   recall, mAP: Mean   Average   Precision   is   used   to   analyze   the   performance   of   object   detection   and   segmentation systems.Visualization: Generate    comparative    graphs    and      tables      to      present      results,   facilitating easier analysis of   the performance of each algorithm.   This   will include   plots of accuracy across different algorithms.
Expected Outcome: The report   will culminate in a comprehensive report   featuring detailed graphs and   tables   comparing the   results   of   all   implemented   algorithms. To   implement   and   process data using hardware and software implementation.Submission: Please read   the student handbook as a reference.   The report should   be      the      student    handbook      formatted    and    include    elements    such      as      graphs,   ﬂowcharts, equations, tables, and   references.   Ensure that all source   code ﬁles,   datasets, and relevant materials are uploaded to Blackboard.   Your code/program   must be normally executed using the OS   you provided and include a README ﬁle   that explains how   to execute   the code/program.
Knowledge/ Skill/ Tools Required: 
Programming   language   (Python   is   Recommended),   algorithm   design   (Machine   Learning   / Deep Learning is an   added advantage)
